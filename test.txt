Hey guys. So, I don't know whether I want kids or not, but this video is going to convince me to or convince me not to because I'm having a raw conversation with a real life mother. Okay, we all see the moms on Instagram and Tik Tok just making it look so fun or making it look absolutely terrible.
And I just can't believe the internet. So, I thought I would go to the source. Okay, we're going to talk to my sister who's a mother of two under two. Okay, she's in the trenches.
But I just thought this would be a interesting conversation, especially for any moms or people potentially wanting to have kids. Even guy guys, you can watch this too if you want. But it was a really nice conversation and we'll see if she convinced me by the end if I should have kids or not.
Also, you're glowing today. I hope you know that. Are you pregnant? Just kidding. If you are, you're glowing. And if you're not, you're still glowing. Okay, let's get into it. Hello, welcome. We have my sister Jessica. >> What's up? >> Yep. Just the different version of me. A different font.
Basically, the mom font. >> The mom font. >> Mom font. Long hair. >> Yeah. Yeah. I like the long hair. The long her hair is long, >> dude. It's I know. I was watching your hair the whole time I was visiting. I was just like looking at it when you walked by from behind.
I'm like, you like you look like such like a like a medieval granola mom. Like in the best way. I was like she needs to be in a corset and a dress like in a castle. >> I think I got to go get a good a good a good trim. >> I like it. >> I like it too. I love it.
>> But yeah, just a little >> got a good trim. I'm about to uh these here are about to fully go away post. >> Oh, we're getting right into it right now. >> Oh, yeah. Sorry. >> This whole this whole video No, it's fine.
We just We talk about her being a mom all the time and me >> potentially eventually being a mom. And we just thought it'd be fun to I thought it I thought it'd be fun to interview a real life mother >> who's living a real life life.
And I'm going to see if she can convince me if I should have kids or not. We'll see. In >> the thick of it. >> And Yeah. Yeah. >> I'm not going to sugar coat it, though. >> No, I know. I hope you don't. But yeah, starting with hair. When's the last time you've gotten your hair done?
>> I think it was June. >> June. >> Yeah. And then I got it cut I think the month before that. So, it's been what is it? Like almost November. So, it's not bad for like the ends aren't super bad, but it's due for a trim. >> Yep. >> Yeah.
And I'm like, I didn't start noticing hair uh disappearing um with my first baby until month four >> after having >> Yeah. >> George. >> Yeah. >> Yeah. >> It was like >> you were like, "What's happening? I'm turning into dad." Or dad's bald. >> Yeah.
And I was like, "Oh, maybe I'm like not going to get postpartum hair loss. Like it's still fine and >> different." And then like I brush my hair and I'm like >> this whole like I'm talking like you it's very light but I'm talking it was gone. This whole thing was gone.
Jojo Siwa gone on both sides and then in the back. So like right now I have like it's like road it grow grew like this long since I had George but it was all gone. So, it's like I lost a bunch in the back and then it grew this long. >> Like you chopped off the back.
>> You seen that t those Tik Tok sounds where it's just like it's like once I birth this baby, uh, go through the newborn phase, get my kid in daycare, go through like kick out postpartum depression, kick out postpartum anxiety, grow my hair back, it's over for you all. Like, >> yeah. Yeah.
Just all these things. It's like >> you can't even imagine what a batty I'm going to be >> 12 to 24 months from now. >> Not even like 3 to five years. >> Well, that's the thing, too, is like >> how how long before you start feeling like a person again after you give birth?
>> For me personally, >> I know everybody's different, by the way. >> Everyone's different. I'm this I'm only going off me. Um I felt a a little bit more normaly when I stopped breastfeeding. >> Yeah. >> However, I was still I I was pregnant with the second at that point.
>> So I feel like I haven't felt like like truly myself >> in a good while. Like >> Yeah. Cuz you had two back to back. You are two under two. >> Yeah. So, I feel like >> everyone's gonna go back and forth with like what's the best age gap?
Like I that's like my whole feed all the time, like what's the best age gap? What's the best age gap? >> I know. >> You got to do what's best for you and your partner. That's probably all I'm going to >> But at this point, you said you wouldn't do it again. >> I two.
>> When I say two under two, I'm technically I was only two under two for like a month. My kids's two now. >> So, it's not two under two. >> Um I said that before. Now I'm starting to get into a groove a little. It's hard as heck, but I'm starting to get in a groove a little bit.
And I like that they will be close in age, especially these first two. Um, and it's it worked out, I think, kind of cool that I had two boys. >> Yeah. >> Um, I don't know.
There's so many different things like I think for like um with doctor or doctors like medically I think they do recommend like waiting more than two years just for the body to recover which I get too but like I also hear a lot of two under two parents they go yeah it's really hard for the beginning
>> for a long while but then it's awesome because they play together they're in the same chapter of lives together all the time like pretty much kind of thing. >> Yeah.
I feel like it'll be a good payoff later on, but it seeing you go through what you're going through makes me not want two kids under two if I even wanted kids. >> That's fair. I've heard a lot of people love the three age threeear age guy. >> Yeah. Yeah.
Cuz they like get it cuz you can't really reason with George right now. >> Not at all. >> No. >> Not even close. Um but potty trained um sleeping through the night probably like uh probably sleeping in their own room. It's dependent on the family. I still sleep with my kid. >> Um not this one.
This one's in his safe space bassinet. But >> it's just like you've established more. Also like George is like super mommy right now. Loves daddy. Wants to do a lot of fun things with daddy. But like when it comes to sleep, when it comes to just that comfort, it's still mom.
>> It's so mom and >> Yeah. You're you're their person. >> I could really push Adam a little bit like like daddy a little bit more >> like but at the same time it's like he's going to want who he's going to want. >> Yeah. >> Like it's it's just and it's not like Yeah. I don't know.

Thank you to Raycon for sponsoring this video. And let's get back to it. What's it like being a 24/7 um maid and and butler? And >> it's a lot actually. My >> I think the thing I hate the most is like I I wasn't really a cook before. Um so that's really hard for me. Dinner.
Dinner's like dinner's like the looming >> I don't even have kids and I don't like it. >> I hate it. So like and and that's like a big thing between um Adam and I. It's like it's like he loves to have a dinner and he's home. He's a teacher, so he's home a little bit earlier.
So, we we can talk about it and see what we want and stuff, but it's like it's like I'm sorry, this isn't the time for like we're doing like uh a pan fried steak and making mashed potatoes and doing all this other stuff. Like, it's >> meal prep at all. No. No.
And luckily, Adam's Adam's family helps out a little bit here and there. His parents and I live with our parents now, too. So, mom's always like, >> "Oh, yeah. Shade to my mom." Sorry. >> Yeah. I have extra. I have extra. Which is awesome. And then, >> yeah.
>> Um my in-laws are like like usually giving us if not one two like two meals a week. And that's like I'm at the five week stage. before they were like trying to make sure we had dinner every single night. >> That's nice. >> Dinner every single night between parents for a big help week.
>> And mom and dad help you as well or mom and dad. >> Oh, they're like babysitters sometimes, which is great. >> That's probably one of the things that I totally understand this our generations people are not having kids are not having as many kids because they don't have the village. >> Yeah.
No, that's Yeah, that'd be a big thing for me because you guys live in Canada and that's why I'm just like like I have Caleb's family here which is great, but everybody's kind of spread out and there's just something about your >> your family >> like wanting my mom like with me while I'm taking care
which they would probably come down and all that kind of stuff, but >> Oh, yeah. Mom and I were even talking before like, "Oh, if Christina have kids, like like both mom and I were like, "We'll go down for like the first like the month, like just be around her.
>> I'll bring I'll bring my kids and we'll just hang out." And cuz when you and Alyssa came up when Teddy was a couple weeks old. >> Yeah. >> Have no idea how much that helped me mentally just feel that kind of normaly having my sisters around. I didn't have you guys with George.
Like I had you for a few days here and there kind of thing. You were back and forth. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was traveling a lot. >> A lot. And so you would only be for a couple of days kind of thing and blah blah blah.
But even though you guys only came for a couple of days or a few days this time, it was still I had you both at the same time. >> Yeah. >> And it was just kind of like And then we were all in The other thing was we were all in the same house. >> I know.
And it was like being it was like being transported back in time except there was kids thrown in >> the best. And I do feel like, okay, you've watched my kids long enough or oh, you've helped my kid long. I'm so sorry. Like, I'll take it back. I'm not trying to use you.
>> I never felt like she's got to take her kid. >> Yeah. And then dad kept me >> Dad kept giving me heck being like this isn't like a you're dumping your kids on us, Jess. Like we want them.
That kind of reminds me of uh this thing that I've seen so much of and that's like just like mom guilt especially on like Instagram and Tik Tok and all this stuff. Moms get on. >> I could cry right now. >> I It's okay if you do. Moms get on. Not not as much as dads.
Let's just and that's just a fact.
But like no matter what you do, and I feel bad because I've caught myself not not on you or anything, just being like, "Why don't you just do this?" I'm not a mom and and I and I know in the in the moment I'm I'm not judging you or something, but it's just like you get enough.
I'm just trying to give suggestions. >> I know based off I know what you mean when you do it kind of thing. I'm not >> Christine, I'm sorry.
But like, god forbid, you post something and you're like, I did this with my kid today, or this is how I handled this with my kid today, or I co-s sleep, or I don't cos sleep, or I do this, and that's it. And everybody's like, you're a you shouldn't have a kid. I don't know.
What's your experience with that in social media? Cuz I know you don't post like your your kids or like being a mom or anything like that, but like seeing it and then comparing it, >> like comments and stuff. Yeah.
because like sometimes you go to social media or um >> it's like like support in your own decision. So like like I sleep with my 2-year-old son George, >> right? >> And I follow this one this one mom her family they they living space they actually had like two living rooms or something.
They ended up making the living room a bedroom. They have two king-siz beds pushed together and it's a family of four and they all sleep together every night. >> And now where she bed shared with like her child before they turned one like zero to one kind of thing. >> There we go.
I'm kind of judging again low key. >> Yeah. So that's where people judge. And now like and now our sister Alyssa, she's seen the worst. >> She's a pediatric nurse by the way. She's seen the the deaths with um um bed sharing and it's really scary.
Um now being a mom, >> even with this little guy >> now, I would never I do not never bring Teddy in the bed with George and I. George is >> George is way too much of a wild card, right?
But if George is gone with daddy or something and Teddy and I are sleeping um during the day, I have had Adam like I'm like, "Can you just watch the monitor? Like I'm going to side lay and breastfeed Teddy and I'm so tired. Like >> you could fall asleep." Yeah.
>> And I will and like I could fall asleep and sometimes I as a mom I do feel like I have the instincts that I would wake up, >> right? But then you do see those deaths happen and you think those instincts.
So I've I've co-slept with Teddy >> maybe two or three times during the day and Adam has been checking on me kind of thing >> with Teddy and everything. But it doesn't take that long. Anything can happen. I know.
>> But to go back to like >> what you're saying like Instagram and comparing yourself and seeing comments and all that >> sleep training, right? I don't sleep train. >> I don't sleep train. I'm I have the luxury though of staying at home >> of being at home. Yeah, I'm tired as >> well.
Heck, but like >> but on this channel >> Oh, right. >> Yeah, he'll bleep it out. Fine. >> Tired of Um but it's just also like a feeling that I don't want to cos sleep. Yeah. >> Maybe maybe Teddy will give me a run for my money and I'm like no.
Yeah, George George gave me run for my money for like through the regressions and stuff and I was like no like I can't do the cry it out. I know that there's softer ways to to sleep train, but for the moms that do sleep train. Dang.
Like sometimes I'm like >> I know I see those moms on Instagram and they're like I slept 8 hours and I'm like >> I'm like oh I wish that for Jessica so bad. But >> well, are then like you know what you know what I get way more jealous of is like the kids that just >> go to bed.
They're like, "Oh, bedtime." >> Yeah. >> Yeah. And I feel like it's usually girls whenever I see those kids. It's like girls like Yeah. They're like, "Okay, I'll go to sleep. See you later." >> And George is not like that at all. But then that goes also with like temperament of babies. >> Yeah.
Every baby's different. That's the thing, too, is >> Some sleep trained babies are like so easy. Some sleep trained babies took forever to get sleep trained. Some sleep trained babies are just like, "Oh, I sleep all the time." >> Yeah. >> I swear my kid just has so much stuff going on in his head.
>> Yeah. >> All the time. And that's and that's kind of why I ended up sleeping with him around like 14, 15 months >> is like I not and I kind of stopped breastfeeding around that time, too. >> Yeah. And he just wanted my skin.
Like he would kind of wake up in the night and then he'd rub my skin and he'd go back to sleep. >> Yeah. He's a little lovey lovey boy. >> Yeah.
And I'm like, why am I going to just sleep without him and then he wakes up and then he wakes up fully and then his mind's going and then I'm having like to like wrestle him to bed. So that's what just worked for me.
But the mom guilt with other people seeing comments of being like, "You should do it like this. You should do it like that. Why don't you do it like this?" I'm like, I don't I don't know if I'll ever want to talk about being a mom. >> And that's fair. Yeah.
I get like I've never said you should do mom stuff or this, but if you did, I would be like nervous for your mental health. >> It' be a lot. It'd be a lot. And like you can put yourself in that mental spot of like whoever says what, I don't care. It's how I do it. >> It's extremely hard.
>> It's still not to mention I think it would pile on kind of thing. >> It would. I think so. And like even I see comments of PE like I'll see a video and I'm like good for that mom. And then I see the comments and like this other mom is saying you should watch out for this this this.
You should make sure that it's this this. >> Yeah. It's like you can't do anything right. >> Oh, I didn't even think of that. >> And you start thinking it yourself and you didn't even put yourself out there. >> Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah.
It's like everybody's learning at the same time, but the internet's just such a it's like good for that stuff, I think, in a lot of ways. Like I send you stuff where I'm like, "Oh, this is a good little tip." or something. >> Oh, yeah. >> But then I'm just I see more hate than anything.
And I feel so bad. >> It's so funny because it's like it's it's like mom's together, but like we're we're as one, but then it's also like >> like Planet of the Apes. >> Mom's together, strong apes. >> But then it's like um you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong, you're wrong. >> Yeah.
It's really It's hypocritical. >> It's very hypocritical. Or also, I'm bringing this up, but I also see a lot of it is after birth, you're like bouncing back. That's the biggest thing is I bounced back into it. >> Oh, yes. >> I worked out my ring. I only weighed like 18 pounds after I gave birth.
I'm like, "Oh, this is Yeah, I see a lot a lot a lot of that. I fear like for me um for someone that has like good genetics um I'm breastfeeding in a way that like I think it like you you burn those calories. It's just coming off whatever. I still have a good nice little pouch there.
Um, I'm what almost 6 weeks postpartum and I think I didn't like get back to like, you know, the regular kind of stomach that I kind of had before until like 6 months with George. >> Mhm. >> But it's like it's sad for moms that feel like they have to bounce back right away.
Like uh I just I'm not I'm not um for me I'm not focused on it right now. >> Yeah. You're good. And that's and that's how everyone should be. That's not important. Shouldn't be important. >> It's not important.
But it's also hard because you see these moms like and then like I'll see friends that have had babies and I'm like I'm sorry you had a baby like 3 weeks ago. >> Yeah. >> And you look like that. >> Yeah. >> It's still in my head. It's still like wow. Like what am I doing wrong?
But I know what I'm doing wrong. I'm eating everything in sight or chocolate or whatever. >> Yeah. What's your most mom meal lately? like eating the eating a meal over the sink kind of thing. >> It's so Dude, I'm >> like girl dinner but mom dinner. >> No, we're so sweet people.
Like I say a meal like it's not a meal. Like dude I >> What is it? What is it? What's What's that meal? What's that meal? Quote unquote. >> Probably like a spoonful of Nutella. >> Yeah, that's filling. >> Nutella was on sale at Costco and I was just like >> Oh, I haven't had Nutella in forever.
I haven't either. And I saw it and I was like, "Screw it." And there's just a spoon sitting there by the Nutella jar. I said this to Alyssa the other day, too. And she's like, "So, you do that every day?" I'm like, "Yeah, probably every few hours." >> You're like, "Ted Lasso?
I finally watch Ted Lasso, the peanut butter jar he always leaves open on his counter. It's just Nutella for you." You're like, >> boost. >> So good. It's so much sugar and I just don't care. >> It's fine.
Um, whatever that, but then also um um Adam and I have been having like these like burrito things, carnitas. >> That doesn't count. >> I'm talking about a a >> a peasant mom meal. >> And you know, if I'm trying to make myself feel better, pepperoni stick and a cheese string.
>> Yeah, you're Yeah, your cheese and pepperoni. How long have you gone without showering? >> That's so honest. Um, >> after having baby. Yeah. Or just h being a mom. What's the longest? Doesn't need We don't need to know when it was. >> I would say nine days. >> It's pretty good numbers. >> Yeah.
>> Damn. >> Damn. >> Yeah. I didn't know what I was >> That's fair. I've seen I've seen moms on the internet and stuff be like, "It's been two weeks." I'm like, >> "That's >> It was nine days." Yeah, it was not cuz I was like almost 10 days and I was just like >> I don't even care if he cries.
I have to have a shower. >> Like even lower than I thought. I've been sad and I've done gone longer than that. >> It's But like you're also covered in breast milk. >> Uh yeah, that's fair. >> You smell postpartum bo? >> I've heard it's terrible. Like what do you smell like?
>> I don't have it too bad. I don't have it too bad. I have it on. It's fine. >> What does it smell like? It smells like you. It smells like bo. Like it smells >> sour milk. >> Worse >> and wet grass. >> Yeah.
And when I said I went nine days without showering, like I'm talking like I still took like wipes every night and like wiped myself. >> I'm not judging you. I've gone longer than that. Haven't touched myself. I haven't like >> No. And I'm not I don't >> I've been greased up.
>> I just washed my hair. Like I said to Vicki, so my my mom's best friend uh came over last night to watch Teddy for me. My husband's sick, which is a punch face. >> Convenient. >> Very.
Um but I don't want him holding the newborn while I go to the shower or when I have to do stuff with George cuz George will not let daddy do stuff. Anyways, um I didn't wash my hair for six or seven days. >> Nice. >> And she came over last night and I washed my hair. >> That's nice.
Oh, Teddy's in her in her in her arms right now. Yeah, that's fair. Oh, what is something you swore you wouldn't do >> before you were a parent and now you do it all the time?
Cuz that's what I'm curious about cuz I love to yap about like I'm not going to do this with my future kid if I ever have one and I'm never going to do this but I'm like I I'll probably give into all that stuff.
Um, it's hard because like being so I was a teacher before this and like >> it's like it kind of set me up for like don't don't put some expectations on what you think you're going to do. >> Yeah.
>> But I will say um >> I will say I thought I'd be outside a lot more >> getting like George ready to go go outside. We're going to go do this. We're going to go do that.
Also, you we live in I mean in Canada where it's just bleak and gray most of the year as well >> a lot and then it's like by the time you get up by the time you like get stuff going I have a goal set in mind with Teddy and George um especially George being a toddler now he needs to go outside like
when he was a baby I said I was going to go out for walks and do all this stuff and blah blah blah and I was like no we're just chilling man we're just going to do this we're going to go visit parents and grandparents and call her a day. Like that was the biggest thing.
But now I'm like, "Okay." Yeah. I think I I think I overestimated how easy it was to get out. >> Yeah. Yeah. What What's something you miss that you would just be like, "Oh, I'm just going to go do this." >> Oh, probably just rotting. >> Oh, just rotting. Not even like I'm going to go to Winners.
>> No. >> Like just rotting guilt. like just like sitting on the couch watching binge watching a show for however long you want. >> Um >> and yeah, like now it's like no, I can't do that. Like yeah, I I could um watch my show with George playing with his stuff and everything.
>> It's not the same though. You're just you're constantly head on a swivel. >> Is he choking? Is he? You don't feel good because you don't have good stuff on for the kid or you have the TV on. >> Yeah.
No, I knew I was going to be a screen time mom, so that's not something I >> That's Yeah, you're like fully >> expected it. That's That's fair. >> No. U Miss Rachel's my girl. >> Fair enough. >> She's my girl. Um Sesame Street OG. We love Elmo. That's what George is going as. >> Elmo. Yeah, >> Elmo.
>> She's awesome. and uh newly uh the wiggles. >> That's pretty good. It's pretty good. So when you do leave the house, what's that look like? >> Like when you're when you're baby free, it would take what? >> Oh, >> minutes. >> Yeah. >> No. And I'm someone also that I hate being late.
And as a mom with 10 kids, >> chances are you might be late because things come up. >> How long does it take on average? Two kids under two. I usually start like to go get somewhere. I'll start I'll start like prepping like probably 45 minutes in advance. >> That's crazy. >> Yeah.
>> It makes sense, but it's crazy. >> Let's get you dressed. Let's change a day. >> No wonder we don't go out there. >> Snacks. Let's make sure there's Let's make sure there's whatever this. Oh, let's like and then but then you're also giving the time of like of like oh crap moments. >> Yeah.
>> Like so. Okay, we wanted to do this at 11:30. And so I'm like, hm, we'll see how long George takes to put down for a nap right now. I'm like, I'm going to give him half hour. Like, we're going to struggle.
He's not going to be super tired just yet, but and he might fight me a little bit, but let's give a half hour. Good thing I did because we get into bed, we get all cozy and I just changed a poopy diaper like 15 minutes before that. He pooped again. >> Awesome. >> And I'm like, >> stellar.
>> Did I leave the poopy diaper somewhere? Like, why do I keep smelling it? And then I look at and I'm like, oh, you pooped again. Okay, let's change it. Let's do it. So, like there's these timings of things that you're like, okay, oh crap moment. Oh crap moment. Oh crap moment.
Is it is it like your your life is very regimented now? Like you can't be spontaneous really. Your life revolves around a lot of nap times and stuff. >> Yeah. But it's also like Okay. Yeah. Um because you don't want to miss a nap time and you do not want to miss bedtime. >> Yeah.
So you're kind of you're kind of a >> you don't you don't and like even if you're go with the flow, >> good on you. Good for you. I hope your kid is just chill as you and you're just >> But if my kid doesn't sleep, >> worry, we got problems and >> Yeah. Yeah. >> It's a lot.
And then like >> I'm I'm honestly so nervous about um Teddy >> because I'm so less anxious this time around. Yeah. Especially about sleep. I'm like, "Okay, let's follow the wake window. Sure. Let's make sure you don't sleep over this many whatever." Blah blah blah.
But like with George, I was like to the minute. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, >> I think most moms are it seems with their first. >> But now I'm like, okay, how am I supposed to like, okay, Teddy has to go down, then George will have to go down like later, and then Teddy will have to go down.
So, am I going to have like one kid sleeping at all times during the day at some point? >> How is this going to work? And >> um but I think that's where like the birth order psychology of like that second kid is just so much more go with the flow. >> Yeah. >> What it is.
Because at that point, a mom has to adapt to just be like, "We're just going to have to do what we got to do." >> Yeah. >> It's going to have to be some car naps. It's going to be like, >> "Yeah, that Yeah, that's good.
But you're you're you're you are um under their thumb for like the past two years. You've just been >> Yeah. So, that sounds not so fun. Well, I I get it. Like, it's an absolute sacrifice. Like, being a mom, it quite literally is a 247 job.
Like, I can't stand the people that are like it's not a job." It's like, >> no, it's it's >> you're keeping things alive. >> Going to work would be would be almost considered a break at this point. >> Yeah, that's great.
>> However, however, it's still like I like for me, I get anxious even thinking about leaving my baby. >> That's a whole other stressful thing. Like moms that have to go to work >> anyways, but like Yeah. No, you're under the thumb. Like I'm just waiting for George to wake up.
Teddy fell asleep, too. So, he's he's going to wake up. We're supposed to go to um the pumpkin patch today. Uh which we'll go to. I have no idea if I'm going to have to like say, "George, sorry. You have to stay in the stroller cuz I have to feed Teddy." >> Yeah. It's constant improv.
It sounds like >> It's like you're on stage all the time doing improv and they're like this and say yes. You have to say yes. >> I'll give you I'll give you our morning. Okay. I talked to you earlier this morning. >> Yes. And I hung up and I'm like >> George was choking by the way at some point.
>> Yeah, >> he was okay. He's fine. >> And uh he was fine. Yeah. And uh then I realized, oh my gosh, we have a chiropractor appointment at 10:15. Okay. Okay. Okay. And usually when we have Cairo, that's when I do a Costco run. >> Mhm.
>> And we didn't eat a lot, but I looked at the clock and I'm like, I think I can make it work. >> Yeah. >> I think I can do it. George, you up for it? You up for it? Costco. He's like, Costco. >> Yeah. Like I said, 45 minutes getting everybody ready. We got to make sure.
So, I was like, if we're going to do it, we got to do it now because we got off the phone at 8:30, right? >> Move, move, move. We get going. It was I get in the car. I'm like, okay, 9:18. Takes about 10 minutes to get there. We'll have 30 minutes in in uh Costco and then we have to go to Cairo.
>> Yeah. >> Made it work. It was all good. Uh Teddy um leaving Cyro. He was sleeping that whole time and then leaving Cairo crying so much that he was not breathing. >> Oh no. >> For a minute. Like I could hear him in the car.
So I had to pull over and go in the back of the car and just calm him down and everything. Then we come back here and I'm like, "Okay, we we're I have an 11:30 thing with you. I still have to get George to sleep. I have groceries in the car that need to go in the fridge. Right.
So then you're like, "Okay, Teddy's still crying his lungs out, so I'm gonna I'm gonna um carry them in his car seat while I slowly unload the the things and then have the door open and keep joking with George being like, "Hey, stranger." Or like whatever. Making it fun, getting stuff in George.
Then I get George out and he's like, "Trampoline, trampoline, trampoline." And I'm like looking at the time. I'm like, "Okay, we have about 20 minutes until I have to put you down. I do have to put whatever." I'm like, "Okay, I can give him 10 minutes. Give Teddy a quick feed.
He's jumping on the trampoline. Lure him in with a chocolate and banana." Whatever. >> Boy. >> Yeah. >> I'm like, "Let's go in." Teddy's still crying his eyes out. I'm still trying to breastfeed, holding him up. Whatever. And then George has a poopy bum. Change his bum.
We >> My heart rate's gone up since this has started. finally get to bed. He needs a diaper change again. We change his diaper. I'm trying to And the worst is you're trying to make it fun the whole time. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're you're an you're an improv. You're an entertainer.
>> Let's go. And then but a a lot of days you're not fun. And then the mom guilt comes in, >> right? >> Makes story long. So, >> no, it's okay. That's fine. That's what it's for like the real the real insight into a actual mom's life.
Is that what stresses you out the most about having kids is just not half time? >> No, not because I'm a homebody. I never go anywhere. So, I'm like, well, my life won't change that much. Like, I don't travel anymore. I don't leave the house really.
Caleb and I just stay in and cuz we we have the farm and the property and we're just kind of like >> hanging out. Um >> my but no, that is a worry for sure. Or not a worry, but it's something like I'm very aware of. I'm like, "Okay, I need I want to be there for them 100%.
I want to be as 100% as I can be." And then the other part is just my cuz I have like severe um intrusive thoughts that compiled with like partly like OCD and depression and all that kind of stuff. But I'm just like and I know I'll be like that when I have my first kid.
Like I will think they're going to die all the time and like how it'll be my fault and then I spiral and I'm like >> yeah that's well >> and also just my life was my my dynamic changing.
Yeah I guess I guess yeah I guess >> yeah well like being someone that doesn't have intrusive thoughts and doesn't >> I'm sure you do you've had them as a mom. I'm like >> as a mom though. >> Yeah >> I have. Right. Like like you look at the kid's neck and you're like, "What if it just >> Yeah.
>> What if it what if I just fell down these stairs?" >> Yeah. >> Would I land forward on top of the baby or would I >> What if I Yeah, it it happens and it it just all the time. Um >> Yeah. Yeah. Less so even like Yes. Yes.
intrusive thoughts, but also just like like we were on the phone earlier like you just said and I heard George and he was fine. He wasn't choking. He was coughing. So that means he could breathe. But he is making those sounds. Teddy's making weird sounds while we're doing this.
And it is my like I am I am so anxious. >> Like I get so anxious. And of course they're my nephews. So obviously I'm But even if any kid like if any kid is like in any sort of distress or life I'm like like I am like >> it's a lot.
It's like if you heard Teddy cry today like Teddy cried the hardest he's cried in his whole life today. >> Yes. It was okay. I'm going to I'm not going to lie. I was impressed with myself with how calm I stayed. >> That's good >> because I've gone through this with George, right?
Like you go through it. But um becoming a mom, like I know you're like, "Oh, yeah. Lifestyle changed this and you know, intrusive thoughts." It's crazy to me how like you just uh you just go with it. >> Yeah. Yeah. Like it is improv.
Like it's just like >> intuition and >> I think like setting yourself up with like like I think before Teddy was born I talked a lot more with Adam of things that I'm going to need of things that I'm going to expect of him. >> Yeah. I think Yeah.
That's >> whereas before we didn't know like I would say zero to one was a bigger change for me than one to two kids. >> For sure. >> It's still hard. It's still >> for sure. For sure. But it's just like your whole your both of your lives change when a kid's in it.
And you just don't you don't know what to expect until you're in it. >> But that's that's one thing that Caleb and I talk about a lot. >> Yeah.
>> And have since we've known each other >> is like >> how who who's going to do what, how they're going to do that, how he's going to support me, how I'm going to support him. >> If we ever get into arguments now, it's just like let's let's pretend we have a kid in this.
Like we we are like constantly doing hypotheticals. >> Yeah. Yeah. >> with a kid, which I think is good. >> I think it's good because it's like for me I'm like I did hypo I did so many hypotheticals with when like just before Teddy came. >> Yeah.
>> I'm like, "Okay, so I'm putting George down and you're doing whatever. It's not going to be like this. >> I'm going to put George down and you're going to have Teddy, >> right? >> Or um I'm gonna have Teddy and you're gonna have to deal with George." >> Yeah. >> Whatever.
So, like we did do more of the hypotheticals and then like um um and to keep it simple, I kind of said I take care of Teddy and as much as and George pretty much as much as I can. You take care of me. >> Like, >> yeah. >> If I need you to take George, you take George.
If I need you to warm me up some food, you warm me up some food. Like, it's just >> And that dynamic works for you guys. it works for us. And then, you know, we're we're like a trade-off couple a lot.
It's like, okay, hey, >> I'll do I'll do like cleaning up all the toys, wiping them, like wiping some stuff down or whatever if time. >> And it's like, >> right. Yeah. I take two dinners and raise you uh three poopy diapers. >> Yeah.
The like, okay, yeah, you and Caleb have been together for a couple years kind of thing. >> Mhm. and not judging it off by the years, but I'm actually kind of going off more of like the age and how well you know yourself now. >> Yeah. Yeah. I think that that adds to it for sure.
>> I think that totally adds to it. I think it's actually more important than the longevity of your relationship is like >> where are you going in with this? So like >> for me when I think about you being as a mom, >> like I totally see it. I've always seen it. Even when you said, "I don't know.
I'm not having kids." I'm like, "Okay." >> Yeah. When I was younger, I was I was like, "No. not having kids. I'm never having kids. And I'm like, maybe not, but yeah, you will. Like, >> you're doing a great job of convincing me. >> You will. And >> my half of day was hell. I No, no, no.
I'm just doing >> Okay, now now I'll like give you a little bit more of it. So, >> you live for the little moments. >> Okay. >> Those were just >> Today we're in Costco. The lady gives him a sticker >> and we always go say thank you. Say thank you. >> Yeah.
>> And I was like, "Oh, thank you so much." >> The like the whole buggy ride out to the car. >> Thank you so much. Thank you so much. >> So cute. >> Thank you so much. I gave him a banana when we got home. >> Thank you so much, mommy. >> You're like, >> Yeah.
in that point when they can actually start to like talk and just >> they're talking or like Teddy like crying crying crying crying and then I know it's a gassy smile but like we came out before we're on the phone with you and >> that's so cute >> and it's just like a gassy smile and you're like >>
and you just know and it's like >> and then seeing your partner >> as a parent especially like the partner that you're like no I want to make him a dad. >> Yeah. and you make him a dad and then you see them just thrive with like >> these different scenarios or whatever. It's like >> it's so cool.
It's so cool. And you're just so full. >> You're exhausted, but you're like >> it's so great. Like even just um even when like I know I didn't handle a situation good or if I know Adam could have handled a situation better. >> Mhm. >> We're at that point where it's like we know that you know it.
We don't need to >> we don't need to say >> mutual understanding. >> Yeah. Or it's like I'm going to step in here. Mhm. >> Your your heightened emotion like or Adam will step in for me if I'm like, I'm gonna cry. >> I'm done. >> Yeah. >> Whatever. >> Yeah.
Cuz you're getting into that good guy, bad guy. Um, good cop, bad cop kind of situation with George now that he's like can talk and stuff. >> Yeah.
And I find that like I always thought like, oh, it's just like the more patient one is like the good cop kind of thing, but really you're saving your partner. You're just saving your partner. Yeah. >> And it's like Yeah.
But anyways, >> yeah, >> it's it's like you're just like you live for the little moments. And I think like when and if you have kids when you have kids, um you're just like you'll be great and it'll be totally fine. And like especially with the level of like like humor in your household.
>> Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm like scared. No, I'm excited, but I'm scared what we'll create. >> Oh, yeah. >> Because we're very like loud and I think we'll be good at entertaining. I think that'll be our our strong suit, which I think it sounds like that's most parenting when they're very young.
>> You and you have to deal with it like like it's the hardest time in a relationship for sure. >> Yeah. >> It's like you want to clock them at one point. It's never about like for Adam and I, it's never about like how he parents that I want to like >> you're doing it wrong. It's not that.
It's just like it's the expectations, right? You're not meeting my expectations. You're not meeting my expectations. That's what's the hard part. But seeing them as a parent, it's like, ah, that's so cool. >> Yeah. I feel like for moms, cuz you're I mean, it's you.
It's you for most at least for most people it's usually it's on you for like I'd say at least the first year you're kind of the parent >> especially with like you know and I'm like >> and if you're breastfeeding and >> I Yeah. And I'll I'll say the term exclusively breastfeeding.
So like my kids don't take bottles like it is all on me and I like it that way honestly. I I'm lazy. That's why >> you don't want to do dishes which I get. I wouldn't want to either. I don't want to pump and put it into a bottle. What? Don't. So, when I say that, I'm not saying it to be. I'm lazy.
>> I don't like doing dishes. >> The pumping moms, I I'm going to say like to you, if you said, you know what, I think I'm going to be a pump. I'm going to just pump and just give them the express milk. I would check in on you every single day being like, are you okay? >> I've Yeah, I've seen this.
I mean, I don't know about it too much, but I've heard like mom's suffering >> pumping. >> It's It's just It's the It's the worst of both.
It's like instead of formula and you just have a bunch of dishes and everything, >> it's you're still using like so much energy of your body and then you have the dishes on top of it. >> Yeah. >> I don't even know.
My friend does it and we're always like, "How did you how did you last?" Like I don't Anyway, >> that's fair. Um, >> good segue into my actual like my biggest biggest fear and that is pregnancy. >> Oh, is that Oh, okay. Okay. So, what are your fears about being pregnant?
>> Well, first of all, as most of my audience knows, I had an ED. >> Yes. >> Still low-key recovering. Um, but I'm I'm like more at peace with that now.
I'm like I've I've recovered to the point where, you know, I have my woman bodily functions back and all that stuff for a long time and I'm capable of, you know, being at a healthy weight and stuff and I'm like good with that and and but I feel like even for women without necessarily an eating
disorder or something like that, it's like >> hard to wrap your head around the fact that you're going to have a different body as as vain as that sounds, which I don't think many women would disagree with me, but it's just like, "Oh, I'm that's really scary. That's really scary.
I'm going to live in a different body." >> Yeah. >> And it's not like And it's just like different like we're talking about your areolas getting bigger. We're talking about like >> Yeah.
>> Like stuff changes colors and stuff stretches and >> and then and then there's a baby inside you which scares me. Like I like that feeling a kid like knowing I don't know. That's like horrifying to me. Oh, okay. >> That's that's also horrifying. >> Honestly, I thought it felt pretty cool. Okay.
Yeah, there was some months that really sucked. My first trimester never actually like threw up, but the nausea, it's a lot. You're so tired. >> Yeah. >> So tired. You don't start feeling them until like halfway through. >> Yeah. >> Right. >> Yeah. That your pregnancies were pretty similar, right?
Your two pregnancies. So, super super like nauseous and tired. First trimester. >> Um, second trimester thriving. Love second trimester. My bump. The bump was bumping. It wasn't like, oh, did she just >> put on some weight? It was like >> your second trimester at my wedding, I think. >> Yeah.
And there's like there's a month and then >> and then um third trimester >> you're doing okay, but those last weeks you're like >> we got lots of snaps from Jess the last weeks where she's like help. >> Yeah. And you're just it's and pregnant with a toddler death. Like you're just death.
>> It's awesome. Like when you're when you when you do get pregnant for the first time, cherish it. Yeah, I've I've and I feel so bad for you. I feel so bad for you. But I've learned from watching you where I'm like, "Oh, I'm gonna savor my first one if I have one.
>> Those bigger age gaps can be helpful, right?" But >> anyways, um and then you like other things in pregnancy. So, I had restless leg syndrome. >> Yeah. Bad for you. >> Like in the especially in the third trimester was worst. Um, I'd be up all hours of the night and my legs are going crazy.
Um, I'm taking too much magnesium that I'm almost like crabbing my pants like just to try to calm it down. Um, I had varicose veins. I like swollen. Um, >> my second pregnancy I was so hungry. I know. >> Oh, yeah. You were just like, she would snap us at like 3:00 a.m.
like I just woke up and I needed to eat five pepperoni sticks and a bowl of cereal. Like, damn, dude. I'm sorry. >> It was just It was weird. But like So, and so yeah, your body is changing. >> Um, >> did your senses get heightened? Like what's with that with the smell and stuff?
Do you become like a superhero? >> I've always been a little bit with smells, but yeah, I think I was also cuz Adam I swear Adam loves the most smelliest foods and I'm just like, >> "Oh, so does Caleb.
>> Out of here." And like I swear that his car smells so bad, but everybody's like, "I don't smell anything." I'm like, >> so yeah, maybe some senses, too. >> Okay. Yeah. Well, okay. >> However, I will tell you this. I've never felt sexier. >> Mhm.
I know you said you've said that, >> which is awesome. I love that for you. >> I mean, the last few weeks where I'm like, >> um I'm like, beach whale, don't come near me. No one touch me. >> Whatever. But like it was just like I don't know. I don't know what it was.
Especially second trimester, you're just like boom boom like look at me >> adorable little >> even if you're like all swollen and stuff. I don't even know. It was just like >> I was swollen. I was this. But it was just I felt uh >> Yeah. I just felt good about it. >> Yeah. Yeah.
It's not that I want. >> It's hard. >> It's hard too. I never >> I haven't gone through what you've gone through. >> Yeah. Yeah, >> very valid thing to make be like, okay, I'm so hyper aware of how I was >> and now I'm going to go and change my entire body.
>> And then be scared of the whole bounce back. >> Yeah. And especially being on the internet, like that's my job. >> So, and just like knowing people will judge me no matter what.
It's like >> but like and you can you can tell me if I'm like like wrong and what how I'm thinking this but like during the time that you did really struggle with the eating disorder like bad >> and then like you've slowly been working on it.
Um >> it wasn't until like a couple years ago um you started being in a stable relationship I find >> that time like yes I knew you were with like your exboyfriend or whatever at the time that it kind of happened but like at that time like >> I I don't think you like were you guys close to >>
breaking up at that time? >> Mhm. Mhm. Yeah. No, it was bad. It was in a bad spot. No. Being being in a >> But I don't want to put it on the partner because >> No, no. It definitely wasn't on them at all. >> No, no, no, no. But I just mean if you got pregnant. >> Oh, yeah.
>> I feel like you're in just such a a stable place. >> Yeah. No, that's that's why I haven't had kids yet because I've been I've been like always very aware that I'm like, I want to be Nobody's 100%, but I want to be as close to 100% before I have a kid.
Especially before I if gosh if I had a if I had a girl I would never want to um project which I wouldn't I'd be like probably overcompensating be like you're perfect you're beautiful but it would be me.
I don't want to ever and this is not a hit on mom at all and mom didn't cause anything of this but on top of us growing up in an age of Instagram and Instagram models and photoshopping and all that stuff.
If so, on top of that, if if mom ever said something bad about herself, I'd be like, and everybody's like, "Oh, you look just like your mom." Then my my brain would be like, "I bad." And I've had lots of therapy and I'm over it now. But anyway, I I just don't want to be negative about myself.
If I even if I have a son or a daughter, doesn't really matter. So, >> society is like you think about like think about Grammy. I'm sure. >> Oh. Oh, our grandma was just like the mo I feel like most grandmas were just like >> honest. Very honest, right? And mom grew up with >> blunt. Yeah.
And we've just been bringing it.
So, I'm just, you know, I'm not trying to break any like, you know, thing cuz I didn't grow up in like a traumatic environment or anything, but I know for me, since I went through that and it affected me in different ways, just the whole thing, I know how I would want to raise a kid now, just not
like not putting any emphasis on uh what you look like and all that kind of stuff. So, I want to be in a place >> naked mom. >> Just walk around in like your unhook for all the time and just be like I'm fine with it. >> I'm a modest mom for sure. I that's not my jam, but if it's yours, whatever.
Um, but yeah. Yeah. So, so I feel like and it's not that I think having a kid would fix me, and I don't want that.
I don't want to I don't want to ever bring a kid into this world to be like, "This will fix something." But I think I think in watching many people around me have kids and and now just my feeling I'm just like I want to care for something other than myself now because I'm good now and Caleb cares
for me and I care for him and I like caring for him but I'm just like I feel like I'm at the point >> where I could care for something else and I could be good at it. >> Yeah, absolutely. Like >> even my chiropractor, she kind of gives me you vibes too.
Um she didn't want kids >> and now she has three. Yeah. And she's like getting to a point in life with like >> so what? I'm going to go and have another margarita on a boat somewhere and have fun with it. Like >> and that's for some people and for people that want to do that all the time.
>> No judgment. No judgment at all. Yeah. But for me, I I have that I have that feeling now that mom and dad said that I would when I was younger when I was like I'm never going to have kids. They're like I think you might want some later.
And maybe some people don't find that person and that person and you're like, >> "Yeah, for me it all revolved around finding the right person." >> Yeah. >> Totally revolved around that.
I was like, "Ooh, I think being a parent with you would be amazing and and making a little person with you would be amazing or adopting a kid or whatever." Um, yeah. >> Whereas I grew up like I want to be a mom, >> which is awesome. Which is Yeah, that's totally fine.
Which brings me to our final um >> uh uh uh phase, which is birth. We kind of went backwards. Um that's also something I'm terrified of. Uh very much so. Experiencing all that pain. >> Um so >> I don't want to talk about it. >> Well, >> okay. >> This is convincing me or not convincing me.
So first >> amazing >> great at my birth >> but I'm no hero I like the drugs I don't I don't do drugs or barely I barely drink alcohol >> in regular life so when I'm first though so I'm like mix up any cocktail you want let's go like >> yeah you had you had your uh >> I had the epidural >> epidural
for the first one >> for just under a couple hours was having applesauce popsicles laughing with my my team, whatever, with my husband. Boom. Baby was out. How exciting. >> Yeah. >> Second birth. Um cervix was in the way. Too late for the epidural. I came into the hospital 8 centimeters dilated.
>> I was fine an hour before. It was like, "Okay, contractions are 5 to seven minutes apart. We're This is when we're supposed to go in. Let's go in." Oh, hi Jessica. You're 8 centimeters dilated. We're going to get you to to a room right away. >> Yeah.
>> Um Oh, we're actually going to send blood work away. We're not going to need you cuz this baby's coming out in 10 minutes. Like >> what? >> Yeah. >> I'm like, okay, baby's coming out in 10 minutes. I'm really pissed off about this epidural, but okay, fine. I won't have an epidural.
Baby did not come in 10 minutes. Did not come in 15. Did not come in an hour. Came in like after 2 hours. and cervix was in the way. Cervix wouldn't go out move out of the way. I don't know whoever if you're listening to this and you're like, "Jess, you're not saying this right." Correct me.
But my cervix was in the way. They had to put their hand up me while I'm pushing. Now, let me tell you this. I will say when it hurt like hell. >> Yeah, >> for sure. But when I was allowed to push during a contraction and no hand was at me, I can see how you could get in the zone.
>> Yeah, >> you can do it. >> Yeah, >> you can do it. >> I was okay. >> Yeah, >> it sucked. But I was okay. What I What I wasn't okay with was when they were trying to move my cervix out of the way for Teddy to come out, >> which apparently he was also weirdly positioned. >> Yeah.
because she said, "This baby's either huge or he's weirdly positioned." And he was just weirdly positioned. Um, and so that was what was really hard for me. So, even if you didn't get the epidural, >> yeah, >> your body your body will do it. You can do it.
You can tap in to that zone and that mentality. I did not. What I would say, what I failed to do was I was so gung-ho about getting an epidural for birth plan. Yeah, >> that was my plan. >> And when that I I just didn't think I would not get an epidural.
I thought I'd go in too early and I'd be sent home. So, I would get that epidural anyway. Don't do what I did. >> Yeah. Just have a plan. >> Prepare yourself mentally that you might not get that epidural if you're like proepad. >> Yeah. >> Yeah.
And the other thing, um, so when I had George, I just wanted it to be me and Adam. >> Mhm. Just me and Adam.
I just wanted I was saying And when I had Teddy, I was like, "Oh, I just want mom to watch George cuz I just feel like good about cuz George has um, you know, mom has put George to bed before when we've gone out or something like that." I felt my anxiety leaving my first at home was so like I was so
scared about that. But knowing that he was with mom, it completely calmed me. >> Yeah. >> But I needed mom >> in that delivery room this time. >> Yeah. >> I wanted mom so bad. >> Yeah. >> I'm like, if I do have this third baby, >> frick, Adam could stay home. I just want >> Yeah.
Cuz I remember the first one.
mom, my our mom and and me were sleeping like on in the on the bottom floor of the hospital like waiting for Jess to have a baby and she ended up just having it with her husband and we're like a but I was like you know what I get that but then yeah like this time around >> that I wanted that special
Adam and I >> but the option's nice if you can have like I would want her to be in the hospital for me to be like or but like I would I think I would like to experience it like you did like I didn't understand it at the time I was Dude, but then I was like, "No, that makes sense." >> No.
Well, like, right. And I just I was just like, "No, man." And like we've had this whole blah blah blah.
And then the second time around, I was like, "Be kind of nice with mom, but like I it just makes me feel so much more calm that George is with >> with my with mom." And George could have been with my in-laws, too. And I wouldn't have felt so worried either.
However, I was just like, "Oh, they've never put him down for bed before." Cuz I never really gave them that opportunity. It's all on me. There's He loves his grandma and grandpa. >> You're right. But it was just >> Yeah.
And so like >> if you do give birth to your first one and you're like, I just want me and Caleb for sure. But like like coming off of me Yeah. I uh I needed mom that second time. >> That's fair. For sure. That's fair.
>> I wish you mom and I was like, >> so don't have a birth plan basically or have one, but also have a plan B and C. >> Have one like Yeah. Like have one and just being like um you want the baby to get a healthy. Yes, I do want an epidural if there's time for one, whatever.
I would just say mentally prepare yourself that the plan just doesn't go to plan all the time. Mhm. >> I have to be rolled. Like I was I was screaming and I was like this close to being like, "Give me a C-section." >> Yeah. >> I'm done. I'm done pushing. Yeah.
>> You can't get my cervix out of the way. Give me a C-section. >> Yeah. Fair enough. >> Almost there. They're almost there. It was And I don't know if any moms can relate to this, but I pushed out I pushed out Teddy.
And you know, people are like, "Oh my gosh." And then that feeling of when you finally push them out and you get your baby. No, I didn't have that. >> Oh, >> I pushed him out. I love my son. I pushed him out and I was like, "Somebody take him. >> Somebody take him to hold him.
Just let let me give me five." >> Yeah, that's fair. I'm just gorilla gripping my vagina right now. I just I can't even imagine this. >> Give me five. >> And it was like, "No, no, no. Here's your baby, Jessica." And you're like, >> "Uh, that's fair. You just need a minute. >> You need a minute.
And even when I had George, I was like, "What? This is my baby." Okay. And then Yeah. >> fall in love. >> Sure. >> And like, but sometimes some women are like >> I don't blame the women that also like they take like a month or so or something. I don't >> I'm not surprised.
No, >> it's so >> it's so crazy. Your hormones. your hormones like >> you're Yeah. Some people get baby blues. Some people get postpartum depression, postpartum anxiety. I get it. I get it. There's people that go like that feel like they're going crazy. I get it.
And I think like I've been fortunate enough No, I have not had postpartum dep. I did not have it with George. >> Our Teddy and I were I'm I'm okay. Um, but it's it's a lot. >> And so you give birth and you're just and it's all about the expectations.
You give birth and they're just like, "Here's your baby. >> You're a mom. >> And you're like, >> I just like I just went through more." >> Yeah. >> Give me a minute. >> Just just a sec. Yeah. Just >> Fair enough. >> And they go, "Oh, by the way, we got to deliver your placenta.
Push a couple You see? Yeah. The after. No. Why does nobody talk about that? How long does that take? >> Um, with George, >> and then they got a push on your stomach and stuff. What's that? >> Oh, yeah. So, with George, it took like half hour. Like, placenta's not coming.
But I had the epidural, so I'm like, whatever. With Teddy, it came within a few pushes or whatever. They're like, can you push again? Can you push a little bit? Okay. Um, Jess, we also need to like give you like a stitch or two. I'm like, can you put freezing down there? Did they >> can you freeze?
Yeah. >> Oh, thank God. >> But I was like, what? I don't have an epidural. Yeah, don't stitch me without like I don't want to feel this. They're like, well, freezing. Here's a needle. >> And you're like, okay. >> And that's the thing, too. I faint when I get a needle, dude.
>> So, when you faint when I >> get a needle, >> if you want morphine, though, >> needle. >> Yeah. For me, it's really like big needle or >> or pushing a football out of my vagina. I'm like leaning towards football. >> I hate needles. Like I don't think people understand.
I cannot stand when something goes in. You don't see it's in the back. >> I know. I've had a spinal tap before >> and I >> But I didn't even feel it. I was like I was I was >> even talking about them. I'm going to pass out. >> Um yeah, that's fair. Yeah.
I think at the moment when you're like experiencing so many contractions, you're just like, "Put it in me." I'm not against epidural either. Caleb's funny.
Caleb was like, "For just for your peace of mind, I'll get I'll get an epidural first so we know and then we can both feel what it's like." I'm like, "That's very big of you. Thank you." He's joking, obviously. >> Yeah.
That would be >> I'm either going to like love him dearly when I'm giving birth or I'm going to like want to kill cuz he's he's going to be like >> what he's going to be cracking jokes and I'm going to be like >> oh Adam was like >> first we were chilling >> first time we were chilling he's just he
was my water boy. He kept giving me water. He held a leg for me. >> Yeah. >> I said don't even look down there. >> Yeah. No, I think that Yeah. I'm like you stay right right up front. Second, >> Teddy, I don't know how many times he said this. It's all temporary. It's all temporary.
I think by the third time, like fifth time, I was like, "Shut up." >> But he's he was trying so hard. >> I know. Yeah, that's the thing. I think I think I'd have to Yeah, I'd have to go into it being like, "What you're about to experience isn't me. It's not your wife.
This will be a monster." >> I was And that's fair. And that's fair. I was like, um, do you still like me? Like, >> yeah. Yeah. Um, >> I know. I just gave birth and I just turned into the exorcist, but am I still pretty? >> Screaming, bro. >> Who was that back there? That was crazy.
Let's order sushi. >> And then and then my my eye I broke like a blood vessel. >> Yeah, you literally looked like you went through an exorcism. >> Took over my whole eye. And I was like just blood vessels broken. And then I I kept complimenting Adam being like, "Thank you for looking at me normal.
I look at myself in the mirror and I forget that I have an eye like this." >> I know. I transformed into the Hulk back there, but I swear >> like Oh, >> yeah. Birth is scary. Your first one though, like they don't come that fast, so you should be able to be okay. >> We'll see.
I'm not I'm not going to I'm going to have zero expectations, I think, getting into it. I'm just be like, "It's going to happen." And it's going to happen however it happens. >> If I do have the third one, the moment I feel a contraction, I'm just going to go in. >> Yeah. Yeah.
You're like, "It's coming. >> It's sprinting out >> with a top hat. >> Give me the epidural." >> Yep. >> And if we like Yeah. You'll be You know what?
I I don't know if I've convinced you to have kids or not, but it's something that um it's going to be a lot of shortterm g a short-term pain for a lot of long term. >> It's going to be what Adam said. It is going to be temporary. >> It's all temporary. >> All these little these little moments.
This two shall pass. >> Shall pass. >> Yeah, that's kind of what And unfortunately, again, you're the first kid that had the first kids >> and I get to just watch you and be like, "Ooh, I like that." Okay. Um Oh, nope. Don't like that. Okay. Not going to do that. Don't do what I did here.
Don't do what I did here. >> So, unfortunately, I'm sorry. You watching you has absolutely helped me with wanting kids. >> It has not deterred me.
I mean, you know, there shows, you know, those times when I FaceTime you and all I hear is and I'm like, "Oh, what's I I'm getting another call." Just kidding. But, you know, when it's you, it's just I don't know. I feel like you just lock in as a mom. You just lock in.
lock in >> and you're like, "This is my life now." >> Or you're just in an outof body experience. >> But then and soon it'll you'll be like 10 or 15 and he'll just be like, "You mom, I'm going to the mall." If there are still malls, I don't know.
And you'll be like, "Bye, son." >> And you can go have a margarita in the pool or whatever. >> Look, sometimes I look, you know what I do? I look at mom and dad. >> Exactly. >> Watching a show. >> Yeah. Hanging out. >> They're just chilling. They're going to Mexico next year. >> Yeah. >> Yeah.

And I'm like, >> "I'm going to be the mother-in-law." >> Yeah. >> Yeah. You are. >> No. >> But I love my mother-in-law. Like my mother and I my mother-in-law and I are like very tight. >> And so I'm just taking notes.
I'm like, "Okay, >> great." >> From what I can tell, as a mother-in-law, you got to cook. >> You got to cook. >> Figure out. >> You got to get better. No, I'm just kidding. I'm pretty good at cook. >> Come back to me. >> Yeah. >> And you always put the daughter-in-laws first.
She will take my side >> every time. No matter how psycho I would be. >> She takes my side every time. So, if you have boys, just know you got to be that mother-in-law. >> I'll be the saucy mother-in-law. I'll be like, "You be him. Let's go by ourselves.
Let's He did what?" >> Well, before I'm like, "My little angels, my little boy." Like, even George and Teddy sometimes I'm like, "When they're babies like this, you're like, "No." And they say having boys is like the slowest breakup ever.
I'm like, >> "Oh my gosh, >> it's true." But then you're just like, but then you do what you can to just keep them in your life and whatever. But it's just like Yeah. But it's funny.
George is two now and there's like It's so funny how I'm like I never thought that I would like really need a break from him. >> Yeah. >> But I'm like, >> "Mom, you said you'd be off at 4." >> Yeah. He's aing menace. >> Please >> get him out of my life. >> Where are you?
>> He's being toxic as right now. done at 2:45 where so many moms have to wait till like 6:00 p.m. for their husbands to get home. >> It is like being in a toxic relationship. He like slaps you then kisses you. >> I said you and then he's like I love you. Yeah, you did.
I was like >> I think if you see that video there is a dad being like, "Give me a kiss." And the toddler slaps his face and then he goes kisses >> and I'm like wait that is so toxic and I love it. It's you're you have like it's like you have Stockholm syndrome. Yeah. >> Yeah. You're like whatever.
>> Yeah, that's all right. >> No, I think Yeah. No, I think uh it sounds fun. Sounds like a blast. Sounds horrifically horrible and also sounds really fun. >> You'll never feel love like you. >> Yeah.
And I believe that because I like the amount I love my nephews is like like the things I would do on their behalf is abhorrent. Like I would do a legal kill. I would murder for them. >> Auntie will do anything for me. >> Yeah. >> I would buy them uh a country if I could like Yeah.
So I can't even imagine. >> I remember even feeling like that. Like I remember feeling like so much love for like like my students. >> Yeah. Yeah. Just kids in general. This is just awesome. >> You're like, you're like, I'm I'm going to love my kid even more than this now.
I'm going to love more than this. What? Hi. How? And then you have your like >> Yeah. I was just hanging out with my my friend's baby two days ago and she's like growing up and she's awesome and she just looks at me and she's like and I'm like want to eat your arm >> in the best way.
Like I'm just like, "Oh, I just want to put you in my sweater." And just >> Well, and like even my best friend, she has her she has two kids. Um, but Scotty, she's three and uh like she is like like a niece to me too.
>> And so like what I feel for her, I'm just like this is so cool and I can't wait for my sisters and my brothers to have kids because we can just have a bunch of nieces and nephews and I'm going to have so many more kids.
And I know >> like as the oldest I'm like as the oldest having the first kids of the family. >> Yeah. I said to Adam, I'm like, "We have an obligation here. We need to raise good kids." >> Yeah. >> Cousins, >> all of these other kids. >> Yep.
>> Cuz we're using our our the aunts and the uncles and the grandparents. Like, >> we're using them. They have free time for our kids. We're using them. So, we're going to have to give them free time. Yeah. >> With our kids. >> Yeah. >> Thing. So, >> yeah.
I mean, that pressure is not on you, but I understand the pressure. Oh, I'm gonna take that pressure because you're going to need a break. >> You're going to need a break. >> Yeah, >> they need to go play. >> I keep going. >> No, no, it's good. It's good. No, we went on for a long time. It's great.
It's great. >> I'm very excited. >> And and Teddy was great the whole time. How nice of him. >> Newborns. We We can Our next segment we can go. >> Let's talk about how awesome newborns are because they can't move and all they do is sleep and >> Well, >> and scream. They scream. >> Scream.
They haven't learned how to or toot, so you have to do it for them. So, >> Right. Right. >> And their sleep is Anyways. Yeah. >> It's all about the baby. >> That's fun. >> Yeah. Well, that's um Yeah. >> I guess final question.
If you can go back knowing everything you know now, would you would you do anything differently? Would you not do it? And so forth. >> Do anything differently? Ah. Um, >> if not that's totally fine. >> No, no, no.
I think to do something differently, I probably would do not when I say reading, not like going through people's Tik Toks, like actual like reading. >> Okay. >> Reading a toddler book right now. >> Yeah. Reading like a toddler book right now. Like how to deal with toddlers cuz my kids, >> right?
And all toddlers are.
But the information that it gives you um yes for sure it helps but the sense of confidence >> it gives you because you're doing the extra work >> yourself >> it's I find that I'm slowly even like I've noticed in the last like few days yeah sure I'll still like snap at George a little bit but like
I'm starting to be like m it's like I have this texture understanding It's like >> that's fair. >> I can tap into something else. I feel more confident. >> That's fair. Any recommendations? >> Right now, I have this one that I'm reading. Transforming toddlerhood.
>> Essential guide for ages 1 to five. How to handle tantrums and power struggles and raise resilient kids without losing your mind. >> Oh, that's pretty good. It's pretty good. >> That's the one thing.
But like like even if like I mean the information is it's more just how you how you can deal with stuff as a parent. >> Just have that confidence to attack it a little bit. >> That's fair. >> That's fair. >> And the other thing differently um don't expect anything with your kid.
Don't expect that they'll be good eaters. Don't expect they'll be good sleepers. Don't expect um uh >> expect the worst and then they'll be great. >> Expect them to come out like the spawn of Satan and then when they're not >> days are days are long, years are short. Take it day by day.
Do the best you can do at that time. If you're going off three hours of sleep, just do your best. Yeah. >> Don't get mad at yourself. >> That's fair. >> But would I do it again? In a heartbeat. >> Yeah. >> In a heartbeat. And even how hard it is now.
I'm like, and how expensive it is, how crazy it is. I I >> Yeah. Yeah. I love it. >> You feel fulfilled. >> Life, >> all right, I'll take this and >> be great. You're going to do great >> and I'll think about it more. If you thought this was like an announcement or something, you're wrong. It's not.
>> It's not. I'm literally I'm This was literally to convince me or not convince me. I'm just kidding. But no, it's not an announcement at all.
just no, it's uh I just see a lot of mom stuff lately and then I'm like, "Oh, my sister's a mom and I talk to her every day." So, also, I didn't do this against her will, by the way. She was totally >> happy to talk about it. >> Willing to do this. I think it was actually kind of therapeutic.
>> You do become a mom. You um That's really all you talk about. >> Uh yeah, it'll become my personality. I'm fully ready for that. Like, what else are you going to talk about? That's your day. That's like my content. All my content is now like about my nephew. Nothing else goes on in my life.
My husband or my nephew. So, I totally get that. That's fair. >> It does become your personality. So, >> yeah, that's fine. >> All right. >> It's okay. Don't worry. Your village will come to you. We'll come and see you. >> Thank goodness. >> You'll be great. >> Yeah, we'll see.
Why do you keep saying that? Like, I'm I'm not having a kid right now, by the way. >> But I already know that you're going to have great >> stand up. Show him your >> now. >> In whatever and however long you decide to have. >> Yeah, we'll see. Maybe it's next year. Maybe it's 5 years from now.
I have no idea. Or not at all. We'll see. And you guys will never know. I'll just show up with a kid one day, but you will never see them. >> Yeah, >> I might already have one. You don't know, you know. Anyway, thank you for doing this. >> Thank you for having me.
>> And moms in the comments, be nice and also help each other out. Let's make it a nice safe space to talk about being a mom and the struggles and all that. And try to convince me in the comments or not. Just talk about whatever you want in the comments. Yeah.
